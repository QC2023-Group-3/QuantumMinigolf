## Introduction

> **NOTE:** This project was created for the HKUST Quantum Computing for Gifted Students GEF 2023-24 course. For more information about this course, visit the information PDF [here](https://www.edb.gov.hk/attachment/tc/curriculum-development/major-level-of-edu/gifted/GE-Fund/2022-07_en.pdf).

Quantum Minigolf reinvents the traditional game of minigolf by incorporating quantum mechanics principles, featuring a golf ball with quantum behavior distinct from classical physics. Developed through basic Python programming, this project serves as a simulation to demonstrate an in-depth understanding of quantum phenomena. It exemplifies the application of complex quantum concepts in a familiar setting, providing an engaging and educational tool for exploring the fundamentals of quantum mechanics.

For more information, feel free to access our presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1osrnnlPmUpl-J32xCmQgU0M5aouOlaEZ45TGqRgsdBw/edit?usp=sharing).

Below are some demonstration GIFs of the game:

## Requirements

We have used Python version `3.12.0`, however any version of Python over `3.10.0` should work.

In terms of library requirements, please check our [requirements.txt](https://github.com/QC2023-Group-3/QuantumMinigolf/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.

## Installation

To install the game, you can either download the source code and run it through Python, or you can download the executable from the [releases](https://github.com/QC2023-Group-3/QuantumMinigolf/releases/latest) page.

If you wish to compile the file yourself, please see the [Compiling](#compiling) section.

## Customization

> NOTE: This is a **work in progress** meaning it is not yet complete and may not provide the most accurate information.

If you want to customize styling, speed, etc, feel free to change the parameters in the `style.json` file. For information on each of these parameters, see the table below:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `scale` | The size of the screen (scale value) - Note that it multiplies the values under `defaults` |
| `resolution` | The resolution of the game itself, the higher the value, the slower the game |
| `duration` | The amount of frames until it checks if the ball is in the goal |
| `colors` | The colors of the game (Obstacle is typical RGB values, whereas the ballHeatmap RGB values can only be either 1 or 0 as they are the multiplier values) |
| `obstaclePresets` | Presets/obstacles you can initially choose from |
| `defaults` | The default values for the game (Recommended not to change) |

## Compiling

To compile the program into an executable, we used [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/). We have actually created a `.spec` file for those of you who wish to compile it yourselves.

The following is a step-by-step guide if you wish to compile it youself:
1. Install PyInstaller with `pip install PyInstaller`
2. Run PyInstaller with `PyInstaller QuantumMinigolf.spec` *Note that capitalization is very important*
3. After running, the executable should be locatable in the `build` folder.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Make your changes and commit them
4. Push the new branch to your fork
5. Submit a pull request
